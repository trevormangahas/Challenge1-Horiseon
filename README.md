# Challenge1-Horiseon
Repo for Challenge 1
This is my refactored version of the Horiseon website.
I added semantic elements so the code is easier to read.
I rearranged the elements so they follow a logical structure.
I added alt attributes to make the website accessible for users with vision impairment.
I rearranged the headings to fall into order.
I added the title "Horiseon" to show off the name of the company more.
