# Code Refactor Starter Code
This is my finished version of the Horiseon website.
I have refactored the code so the website is accessible and cleaned the code up.
I added semantic elements to the code so it is easier to read.
I organized the elements into a logical structure.
I added alt attributes to the images therefore it is accessible to the visually impaired users.
I made sure the headings fell into order.
I gave the website the title "Horiseon" to show off the name of the company.
